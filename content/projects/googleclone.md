Google Clone is a web application that replicates the core functionality and user interface of Google's search engine. Built using the powerful combination of React and Tailwind CSS, this project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in web development, front-end frameworks, and modern styling techniques. By creating a Google clone, developers can delve into the intricacies of UI/UX design, responsive layouts, and component-based architecture.
