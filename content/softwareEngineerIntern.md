# Internship Work Experience: Mendix, Power BI, AWS, Kubernetes, Docker 
<br>

## Project Overview: RapidHR - Empowering Talent Management 
<br>
During my internship, I had the incredible opportunity to work on a transformative project called RapidHR, a Talent Management and HRMS (Human Resource Management System) application built using Mendix. RapidHR aimed to streamline talent management processes and HR operations within the organization, centralizing employee data, managing skill profiles, and enhancing HR functions to facilitate better workforce planning and employee development.

## Mendix Development: Building Innovative Solutions 
<br>

As part of the development team, I actively contributed to designing and implementing various features within the RapidHR application using Mendix's low-code platform. This powerful low-code approach allowed us to create complex functionalities rapidly, significantly reducing the development time. My work involved designing interactive user interfaces and implementing dynamic workflows, honing my skills as a proficient low-code developer.

## Power BI Integration: Empowering Data-Driven Insights 
<br>

We incorporated Power BI into RapidHR, introducing data analysis and visualization capabilities to the application. My role involved integrating Power BI dashboards into the system, enabling HR teams to access critical HR metrics and make data-driven decisions for talent management and resource allocation.

## Deployment with Docker and Kubernetes: Ensuring Scalability 
<br>

A critical aspect of the internship was deploying the application in a scalable and efficient manner. I collaborated on using Docker containers and Kubernetes to orchestrate the deployment process, ensuring seamless scaling of resources based on application demand. This strategic deployment approach enabled us to achieve high availability and optimal performance for RapidHR.
